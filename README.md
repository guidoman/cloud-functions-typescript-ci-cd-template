# cloud-functions-typescript-github-actions

This repository is a fork of [cloud-functions-typescript-template](https://github.com/flatfisher/cloud-functions-typescript-template).

This is a template to develop Google Cloud functions using the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) platform and the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) programming language.

The original code includes scripts to build, test and deploy your function. It also includes a basic GitHub workflow to build and test it automatically.

I've added __GitHub actions to automatically deploy the function to GCP__.

I've also updated dependencies and NodeJS version (using v14).
